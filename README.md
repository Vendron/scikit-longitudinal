> üåü **Exciting Update**: We're delighted to introduce the brand new v0.1 documentation for Scikit-longitudinal! For a deep dive into the library's capabilities and features, please [visit here](https://simonprovost.github.io/scikit-longitudinal/).

## <a id="about-the-project"></a>üí° About The Project

Scikit-longitudinal is a machine learning library designed specifically for the analysis
of longitudinal data. It provides a collection of tools and models for processing,
analysing, and making predictions on longitudinal data, with an easy-to-use interface
that is compatible with the Scikit-learn ecosystem.

For Neural Networks based models, we
recommend to look in the related projecs available in the [Related](#related) section - therefore,
this current project will not provide any Neural Networks based models as of today.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER**: This project is still under development, and the setup is not yet fully automated. It has been tested on macOS and Linux distributions. The assurance of Windows compatibility is currently not guaranteed. However, our Project Packages and Dependencies Manager (PDM) enables cross-compatibility.

### üìå Prerequisites

#### Common Requirements
- [Python 3.9.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-398/). For managing multiple Python versions, [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended.
- [PDM (Python Dependency Management)](https://pdm.fming.dev)
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

#### Linux-specific Requirements
- `libomp-dev` from `apt-get`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libomp-dev
  ```

#### macOS-specific Requirements
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Make sure to open XCODE and accept the license agreement.
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- `SDKROOT` environment variable, typically located at `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/`. Or what also works is to run:
  ```bash
  export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path)
  ```
- `libomp` from `brew`:
  ```bash
  brew install libomp
  ```

### <a id="setup"></a>üõ† Manual Setup Instructions for macOS or Linux Environments

To manually configure your environment, please adhere to the following procedure meticulously:

1. **Setting up the package manager:**
    - Initialize the package manager with Conda as the backend for virtual environments:
      ```bash
      pdm config venv.backend conda
      ```

2. **Selecting Python version:**
    - Specify the Python version for the project. Here, we are selecting Python 3.9:
      ```bash
      pdm use 3.9
      ```

3. **Project Setup:**
    - Execute the setup script. This step may prompt you to export certain variables or configure compilers like GCC or Clang. Please comply with the on-screen instructions:
      ```bash
      pdm run setup_project
      ```

4. **Environment Variables Configuration:**
    - Set the `PDM_IN_ENV` variable to `in-project` to ensure that the package manager operates within the project directory:
      ```bash
      export PDM_IN_ENV=in-project
      ```

5. **Conda Initialization:**
    - Initialize Conda for your shell. Replace `bash` with `zsh` or `fish` as per your shell preference:
      ```bash
      conda init bash 
      ```

6. **Shell Configuration:**
    - Source your shell configuration file to apply the changes. Again, replace `.bashrc` with the appropriate file name corresponding to your shell:
      ```bash
      source ~/.bashrc # Replace with ~/.zshrc or ~/.config/fish/config.fish accordingly
      ```

7. **Activating Virtual Environment:**
    - Activate the virtual environment with the following command:
      ```bash
      eval $(pdm venv activate $PDM_IN_ENV)
      ```

8. **Project Dependencies Installation:**
    - Install all the project dependencies by running:
      ```bash
      pdm run install_project
      ```

#### Troubleshooting Errors

If you encounter any errors during the setup process and are unsure how to resolve them, please follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Deactivate Conda Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```
   
2. **Clear PDM Cache**:
   ```bash
   pdm cache clear
   ```
   
3. **Remove Pypackages Directory (subject of many errors from time to time)**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf __pypackages__/
   ```
   
4. **Remove PDM Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   pdm venv remove_env
   ```
   
After following these steps, try to reinstall the project dependencies. If the issue persists, 
feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository for additional support.

### WINDOWS KNOWN ISSUES

- Git Handling Lines Ending: We recommend that you setup the following git configuration to avoid Windows to automatically add `\r\n` ending symbol line that Linux/MacOS do not understand. To configure, use [this command](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#global-settings-for-line-endings):
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf true
  ```

### üê≥ Docker Setup (Linux, Python 3.9.8)

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### Recommended Steps using [JetBrains (PyCharm) Docker Services](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/docker.html)
1. Build the Docker image using JetBrains Docker Services. Scroll at the top of the Dockerfile and click on the green arrow to build the image.
2. Run the container in interactive mode using JetBrains Docker Services. On the Docker build window that might have appeared. Click on the "terminal" tab that shows up and you should be able to run the command interpreter inside the container.

#### Manual Steps (if not using JetBrains)
1. Build the Docker image manually. Follow the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) to build the image.
2. Run the container in interactive mode manually.

#### Common Steps
1. Inside the Docker container, activate your PDM-based Conda environment by running:
   ```bash
   eval $(pdm venv activate $PDM_IN_ENV)
   # Alternatively, you can run:
   # pdm venv use $PDM_IN_ENV
   # conda activate the returned path
   ```
2. You can now execute your scripts or modify the Dockerfile to include them.
3. For testing purposes, run _(Note: If you do not have the entire ELSA Databases, you can contact us, or ignore the failed tests because of missing data)_
   ```bash
   pdm run tests
   ```

üéâ Voil√†! You are ready to contribute!

### <a id="code-convention"></a>‚úíÔ∏è Coding Conventions
We follow the [Karma Git Commit Convention](http://karma-runner.github.io/6.4/dev/git-commit-msg.html) for commit
messages and a modified version of the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
with fewer restrictions for naming conventions and coding style. Please familiarize yourself with these conventions
before contributing.

#### File and Class Function Naming Conventions:

- **File names:** Snake_case naming convention is used for file names. Snake_case uses lowercase words separated by underscores (e.g., `file_name.py`).
- **Class names**: The PascalCase (or UpperCamelCase) convention is employed (e.g., `ClassName`).
- **Function and method names:** The snake_case naming convention is also used for function and method names. These names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `function_name()` or `method_name()`).

## <a id="faq"></a>‚ùì FAQ

Explore the properties of Longitudinal Data and Time-Series Data in this comprehensive FAQ.

**Q: What is Longitudinal Data?**

A: Longitudinal Data refers to observations made on multiple variables of interest for the same subject over an extended period of time. This type of data is particularly valuable for studying changes and trends, as well as making predictions about future outcomes. For example, in a medical study, a patient's health measurements such as blood pressure, heart rate, and weight might be recorded over several years to analyze the effectiveness of a treatment.

**Q: What are the differences between Time-Series Data and Longitudinal Data?**

A: Time-Series Data and Longitudinal Data both involve observations made over time, but they differ in several aspects:

* **Focus**: _Originally_ Time-Series Data focuses on a single variable measured at regular intervals, while Longitudinal Data involves multiple variables observed over time for each subject.
* **Nature**: Time-Series Data is usually employed for continuous data, whereas Longitudinal Data can handle both continuous and categorical data.
* **Time gap**: Time-Series Data typically deals with shorter time periods (e.g., seconds, minutes, or hours), while Longitudinal Data often spans longer durations (e.g., months or years).
* **Machine Learning**: Time-Series Data are frequently used to predict future values, whereas Longitudinal Data are more frequently used to predict future outcomes. In addition, the ML algorithms used for time-series are frequently distinct from those used for longitudinal data. For instance, Time-Series based techniques are based on time-windowing techniques, whereas Longitudinal based techniques frequently use the current standard for machine learning classification for the prediction task. Nevertheless, they will adapt (create variant of these standard classification based machine learning algorithm) to comprehend the temporal nature of the data.


In summary, the main differences between Time-Series and Longitudinal Data lie in the focus, nature, and the length of the time intervals considered.

## üíª Installation for Developers

Please follow the instructions below for setting up your development environment.

!!! tip  "Prerequisites"
      - [Python 3.9.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-398/). For managing multiple Python versions, [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended.
      - [PDM (Python Dependency Management)](https://pdm.fming.dev)
      - [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

### Step by Step Installation Guide

!!! warning "Fully-working environment setup is not guaranteed on Windows. We recommend using a Unix-based system for development. Such as MacOS or Linux. On Windows, Docker is recommended having been tested on Windows 10 & 11."

To manually configure your environment, please adhere to the following procedure meticulously:

1. **Setting up the package manager:**
    - Initialise the package manager with Conda as the backend for virtual environments:
      ```bash
      pdm config venv.backend conda
      ```

2. **Selecting Python version:**
    - Specify the Python version for the project. Here, we are selecting Python 3.9:
      ```bash
      pdm use 3.9
      ```

3. **Project Setup:**
    - Execute the setup script. This step may prompt you to export certain variables or configure compilers like GCC or Clang. Please comply with the on-screen instructions:
      ```bash
      pdm run setup_sklong
      ```

4. **Environment Variables Configuration:**
    - Set the `PDM_IN_ENV` variable to `in-project` to ensure that the package manager operates within the project directory:
      ```bash
      export PDM_IN_ENV=in-project
      ```

5. **Conda Initialization:**
    - Initialise Conda for your shell. Replace `bash` with `zsh` or `fish` as per your shell preference:
      ```bash
      conda init bash
      ```

6. **Shell Configuration:**
    - Source your shell configuration file to apply the changes. Again, replace `.bashrc` with the appropriate file name corresponding to your shell:
      ```bash
      source ~/.bashrc # Replace with ~/.zshrc or ~/.config/fish/config.fish accordingly
      ```

7. **Activating Virtual Environment:**
    - Activate the virtual environment with the following command:
      ```bash
      eval $(pdm venv activate $PDM_IN_ENV)
      ```

8. **Project Dependencies Installation:**
    - Install all the project dependencies by running:
      ```bash
      pdm run install_project
      ```

### ‚ùå Troubleshooting Errors

#### General Installation Related

If you encounter any errors during the setup process and are unsure how to resolve them, please follow these troubleshooting steps

1. **Deactivate Conda Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```
   
2. **Clear PDM Cache**:
   ```bash
   pdm cache clear
   ```
   
3. **Remove Pypackages Directory (subject of many errors from time to time)**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf __pypackages__/
   ```
   
4. **Remove PDM Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   pdm venv remove_env
   ``` 

After following these steps, try to reinstall the project dependencies. If the issue persists, 
feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository for additional support.

### üê≥ Docker Setup (Linux, Python 3.9.8)

!!! tip "Prerequisites"
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - [JetBrains (PyCharm) Docker Services](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/docker.html) (optional)


#### Recommended Steps using [JetBrains (PyCharm) Docker Services](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/docker.html)
1. Build the Docker image using JetBrains Docker Services. Scroll at the top of the Dockerfile and click on the green arrow to build the image.
2. Run the container in interactive mode using JetBrains Docker Services. On the Docker build window that might have appeared. Click on the "terminal" tab that shows up and you should be able to run the command interpreter inside the container.

#### Manual Steps (if not using JetBrains)
1. Build the Docker image manually. Follow the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) to build the image.
2. Run the container in interactive mode manually.

#### Common Steps
1. Inside the Docker container, activate your PDM-based Conda environment by running:
   ```bash
   eval $(pdm venv activate $PDM_IN_ENV)
   # Alternatively, you can run:
   # pdm venv use $PDM_IN_ENV
   # conda activate the returned path
   ```
2. You can now execute your scripts or modify the Dockerfile to include them.
3. For testing purposes, run _(Note: If you do not have the entire ELSA Databases, you can contact us, or ignore the failed tests because of missing data)_
   ```bash
   pdm run tests
   ```
   
!!! danger "Windows Known Issues"

      Git Handling Lines Ending: We recommend that you setup the following git configuration to avoid Windows to automatically add `\r\n` ending symbol line that Linux/MacOS do not support. To configure, use [this command](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#global-settings-for-line-endings):
        ```bash
        git config --global core.autocrlf true
        ```
   
## ‚öôÔ∏è How To Build The Distribution Packages
